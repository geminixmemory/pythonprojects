#### Description:
Welcome to GEMINI's PDF Editor, a command-line interface tool designed for efficient PDF manipulation. This program enables users to edit PDF documents and save the results in a new file, replicating the functionality of web-based editors but with the flexibility and speed of a local application. It supports several essential PDF editing operations, including files compression and merging, page(s) removal and rotation. Designed for ease of use, it requires no prior coding experience, making it accessible to non-tech users. 😎

## Background Introduction
As someone more fascinated by practical applications than game design 🎮 , I've always been intrigued by tools that offer real-world utility. 👨🏻‍💻 PDFs are one of the most popular doc formats in digital communication, making them an ideal focus for creating “meaningful” editing software. This project was inspired by the foundational work of other generous programmers, allowing others (even an amateur like myself ;) to build upon it. Utilizing the Python module PyPDF2 and drawing from my studies in the CS50 course "Intro to Python Programming", I crafted this user-friendly PDF editor. It's intended to enhance your productivity and make PDF editing as straightforward as possible 💯🚀🎯.

## User Manual
To get started with GEMINI's PDF Editor, simply choose from one of the available editing functions listed below. The program will guide you through the necessary steps, prompting for file names and other inputs where needed. Each function is designed to be intuitive, with clear instructions provided as you make selections:

1. **File Compression**: This feature reduces the file size of your PDF, making it easier to share and store. After selecting the PDF file, the program compresses it and saves a new version appended with "compressed" at the end of the file name.

2. **Pages Rotation**: Need to adjust the orientation of your PDF pages? This function allows you to rotate specific pages to your desired angle. Specify the page number(s), separated by commas (if more than one page) and the rotation angle—90, 180 or 270 degrees.

3. **Pages Removal**: Simplify your document by removing unnecessary pages. After choosing this function and the target PDF, enter the page numbers to be deleted, separated by commas (again for multiple pages only).

4. **File Merge**: Combine up to five PDF files into one. Start by specifying the quantity of PDF files to merge, then enter each file name in the order they should appear in the merged document.

Furthermore, a “gatekeeping” validation function is incorporated to check all user inputs for errors (e.g., format non-compliance), ensuring the program runs smoothly without crashing.

### Key Features
- **Core Functions**: Includes tools for compressing, rotating, removing, and merging PDF pages.
- **Scalability**: The architecture of the program is built to accommodate additional features and capabilities for future updates.
- **User-Friendly**: Each function is explained with step-by-step instructions, ensuring ease of use for everyone.
- **Performance**: Operates more quickly and efficiently than many web-based PDF editors.
- **Privacy and Accessibility**: There are no restrictions on use; no personal data is collected, and no registration is necessary, ensuring your privacy is well respected 🛡️.
- **Cost**: The tool is completely free to use, although donations to support future development are always appreciated 💸.
